# academy (Java Full Stack Developer)

This repository contains exercises (guided or not) related to some of the main topics covered during the course of the academy. Below is a brief description for each of them.

## bookstore

A Java application for managing a library (creating, searching, updating and deleting books) developed during the first weeks of the academy. The data access logic was implemented using the DAO pattern (first with JDBC and later with JPA). The application also includes tests and a DB created with MySQL Workbench.

## html

A project containing the first examples of front-end programming (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and use of the Bootstrap framework. The same technologies were used for a first implementation of “Number Guessing Game” with client-side logic. To start and test the correct functioning of the application, http-server was used.

## demowebapp

A web app implemented using JSP and Servlet, also containing the implementation of "Number Guessing Game" with server-side logic. The technology used for the deployment and launch of the application is Apache Tomcat.

## demorest

The first Spring Boot project aimed at implementing "Number Guessing Game" as a web service (REST). Postman was used to test the correct functioning of the service.

## bookstore-api

A Spring Boot project for the implementation of a web service (CRUD REST) ​​for book authors, having the bookstore project as a basic "library" (parent). In this case, the data access logic was implemented using Spring Data JPA.

## ng-tasks

A single-page web application, developed during the last week of the academy, aimed at using some of the main features of the framework (components, directives, services, routing). Inside there is also the implementation of "Number Guessing Game" as Angular's component.
